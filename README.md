- 👋 Hi, I’m Ansley Davis (@ansleydavis) a 3rd year Ph.D. Candidate. I am at the University of South Florida pursuing my Ph.D. in Communication Sciences and Disorders. Before starting my program I worked in the public school system as a Speech-Language Pathologist. My primary research interests are the influence of social cognition and language on social communication skills, translational research in community & education settings, and overall youth development. I use behavioral methodology (e.g., eye tracking, observation, etc.) to explore these topics through quantitative and mixed-methods research designs. My overarching goal is to contribute to the dissemination of evidence-based interventions that targets social-emotional outcomes for youth. I hope to accomplish this by collaborating with other disciplines to better understand adolescent mental and behavioral health.
